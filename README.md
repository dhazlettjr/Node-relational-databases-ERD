# Node-relational-databases-ERD

Wait. What's an ERD?

An Entity-Relationship Diagram is a visual mapping of the relationships between tables in a database. We will work through how to make an ERD in class, and complete this exercise together.

Download the musichistory.db file, and then copy it to the folder that you created for this exercise. That file is the database. It contains all of the tables and data.
Install our Database Browser - there are tons out there, but let's use DB Browser for SQLite
Open then Database Browser and click 'open database' - select the file you just downloaded
Glimpse through the tables and see if you can get a sense of how on earth they are related.
Let's use one of these tools to create an ERD and see if we can't get a better sense of how these tables are related:
